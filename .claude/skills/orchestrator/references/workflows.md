# Workflow Templates

Quick-start paths for common scenarios. These templates fast-track phases — they do NOT skip them. Every numbered step below is MANDATORY. If a step is lightweight, complete it quickly and log it, then move on. Do not silently omit any step.

## 🐛 Bug Fix Workflow

**Duration**: 15-60 min | **Skills**: Tech Lead → Backend or Frontend (+ DBA if data issue) → Tester

```
1. REPRODUCE
   → User describes the bug
   → Locate the relevant code
   → If DB-related: DBA reviews queries/schema
   → Confirm: "I see the issue in [file:line]. Here's what's happening: [explanation]"

2. OPTIONS (simple → complex)
   🟢 Quick patch: [minimal change]
   🟡 Proper fix: [addresses root cause]
   🔴 Refactor: [fixes the pattern, not just this instance]
   → "Which approach?"

3. FIX
   → Apply the chosen fix
   → If migration needed: DBA writes migration
   → Show the diff briefly

4. TEST
   → Write/run test that would have caught this bug
   → Run existing tests to check no regressions
   → If auth/security related: Security Engineer quick review

5. DONE
   → "Fixed and tested. Ready to commit?"
```
